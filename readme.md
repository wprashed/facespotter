## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- A webcam or camera connected to your system
- Supported operating systems: macOS, Windows, Linux

### Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python face-recognition numpy pillow
```

For macOS users, you may need to install OpenCV with AVFoundation support:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless
```

### Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Ensure the following directories exist in the project folder:
   - `encodings/` (for storing user encodings)
   - `images/` (for storing user profile images)
3. Place a custom icon file (`icon.png`) in the root directory if you want to use a custom application icon.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Camera Not Working**:
   - Ensure your camera is connected and working properly.
   - On macOS, try installing OpenCV with AVFoundation support:
     ```bash
     pip install opencv-python-headless
     ```

2. **Indentation Errors**:
   - Ensure all code blocks are properly indented (Python uses 4 spaces per indentation level).

3. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - Install missing dependencies using `pip install <package-name>`.

4. **Face Not Detected**:
   - Ensure the uploaded image has a clear, visible face.
   - Adjust lighting conditions when using the camera.

5. **Old Reports Not Updated After Renaming a User**:
   - Ensure the `update_username` function is correctly implemented to update both the `users.csv` and `user_tracking_report.csv` files.
